It‚Äôs that simple, a central planner will never producer as much raw output as markets, profit maximization ensures that producers will create the things humans need to survive, because those are the things humans demand. If there‚Äôs a short supply there‚Äôs money to be made, producers enter, etc etc you get it. The reason why we see failiures in the US is artificial costs. If the marginal cost of housing is inflated it can NEVER be an efficient allocation, it will always be under supplied. We need policies aimed at fixing markets and at the end of the day the average person will be much more materially wealthy than a citizen of your system, even if yours is more equal.

My father loves to go on and on an on about how we need to go back to small business, free trade, no regulations. Theres already so many problems baked into that fantasy (small business capitalism basically didnt exist - monopoly-trans-national capital has been a mainstay of capitalism for over 150 years). But the most ridiculous part is how infeasible it is. What that strain of politcal-economic Fantasy has in common with yours is that it argues that regulations and quotas and central planning is somehow politically separate from the market and market forces. In actuality, so many policy decisions are pushed and funded by corporations, business people and industries in their self interest. Self-interested business elites enter politics or pay off cronies in office to pass legislation which gives them an economic edge, maybe keep them afloat, maybe dump artificial sums of money into the market, and things start to break down. I agree with you that these overlapping regulations start to make markets break down. But to overthrow that political-economic system that has been in place for over a century now would require a kind of despotic clairvoyance, and one that somehow manages to defend itself against the political backlash from Capital, the likes of which the world HAS seen... but hasn't liked (fascism).
True Keynsianism has never been tried because its political goals are in direct contradiction with its basic economic reality.
As a Marxist, I advocate for an economic end goal that is coherent with the political process required to achieve it (Economic and social revolution).
To the point u made in one of these comments regarding Socialism's tendency to inefficient outputs, I have to admit Im not familiar enough with the economic principles you were laying out, but I do generally agree with you that in its later half, the soviet union was extremely inefficient. however, by that point, bourgeois elements within the government had taken over and directed the economy to a state-capitalist model rather than socialist","05/07/2025, 12:29:53",1,No,,,https://www.tiktok.com/@userv6630ej7fs

However, I think China is currently showing that the western capitalist models aren't the only or most efficient capitalist models. Theyve managed to simultaneously explode living standards in the country while also maintaining their productive dominance and dynamism. It does seem however that they are being forced to compete more and more for foreign markets and that the apple is slowly losing its shine, and their Boom is nearing its end.

My economic plans do require political change to happen. Firstly citizens united needs to go. Along those lines id like to see individuals only able to donate to reps/senators that would represesent them at their primary residence. I‚Äôd fund more staff for congresspeople to write their own bills and do their own research, because they rely on industry to write bills all the time and often don‚Äôt have complete information. I think those steps would really really improve the special interests aspect of our system. It will also probabaly require some changes to the Intelectual property rules, because those mess up markets, but I‚Äôm not a lawyer, I don‚Äôt have my own solution for this. Now we can get to the fun stuff, every policy you roll out is designed to make markets more competitive. You can do this by trying to reduce mobility and startup costs. Each market needs a different policy, but you could get rid of zoning laws so the market can build homes where it‚Äôs most useful for instance. The profit maximizing nature of true capitalism will always ensure that the person with the most use for a resource will end up with it. This is true in production and consumption. Apple has a better use for the silicon the goes into their chips than a window company(they produce more output with it) and so they end up with as much as they want. In a planned world you get so much deadweight loss. It‚Äôs impossible for a planner to have all the information available and to destribute resources correctly. It just automatically works in an auction. It goes to Apple untill their marginal cost of each new iPhone = the marginal benefit of the final consumer. Then the rest of the silicon goes to others. If for some reason a compassionate government decides that the market doesn‚Äôt allocate enough iPhones then they can subsidize the production of iPhones, which lowers the marginal cost, and more can be made. Resources will automatically be reallocated because of the auction. You can do this in any market.","05/07/2025, 17:29:07",0,No,,,https://www.tiktok.com/@learn.econ

They‚Äôll fund hella startups and watch them compete in a market untill they have a few winners, then invest huge sums of money to create a kind of unbeatable force. The reason it‚Äôs unbeatable is because at that point they‚Äôre no longer in actual competition with American companies, they‚Äôve been artificially boosted. The issue for them is they only have a few companies like this, the US has 100s that have all grown naturally. China only wins in the markets it deliberately chooses, and I think they‚Äôve been lucky so far picking winners. Secondly even with the market forces they make allocation mistakes. I‚Äôm sure you heard about the massive trillion dollar land developer that built so much vis government subsidy they collapsed and left literally 100s of thousands of empty units around the county and defaulted on line 500bn worth of debt. It almost crashed the entire Chinese economy. This was back in like 2022 I think the firm was ever grand or something like that if you‚Äôre interested. The third possibility with China is that a mixed economy is going to be better than pure capitalism (get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù allocations), but I wouldn‚Äôt come to that conclusion given that a big chunk of their population lives on less than 5 dollars a day. Not nearly as rich as even the poorest Americans.

For example, participation 401(k) or similar opt-in retirement plans, show irrational and contradictory results. A rational agent would opt-in 100% of the time because data shows it‚Äôs the most optimal outcome. However, immediate personal needs, distrust in pension systems, etc. results in ‚Äúirrational‚Äù participation rates. To your next point, how do you control for a post war boom? That‚Äôs a massive one off event that makes up the majority of recorded economic data. Econometric studies of tax policy of this era doesn‚Äôt capture qualitative factors like shifts in consumer expectations or entrepreneur optimism that may have arose during this era. A major gap that tax policies fail to capture is the housing boom that was a result of the GI Bill subsidies. Finally, and this is something that Austrians kind of circle jerk about as their greatest accomplishment, econometric models used by the largest financial institutions and central banks, using data collected by the best mathematicians, statisticians, and economists FAILED to predict to the 2008 financial crisis. Historical correlations of housing prices, mortgage defaults, economic conditions, etc. failed to capture subjective factors that drove the crisis like overconfidence in housing markets. No model can capture the fragmented, decentralized gaps in knowledge, confidence, and preference of millions of irrational actors (homebuyers, bankers, regulators, etc.). Austrians would argue that only a priori reasoning explains the housing bubble driven by artificially low interest rates and entrepreneur misinformation and overconfidence.

A good way for us to implement communism is for every political party to form their own union. The union represents the workers and influences businesses.
.
Capitalists already control our economy through their businesses, we are just transfering control to political parties, as well as adding welfare to ensure the government is financially responsible for us. The owners still ""own"" the business (unless the party has an issue with that)
.
Since there will be multiple different political parties, our unions will be competing against eachother not only for a salary...but for political dominance over the production line share value.
Unions are more like political parties in the sense that people aren't obligated to support them, therefore, representatives are put on a leash to the people they represent.
.
This competition would improve our economy....And it directly humors the ""human nature is greedy"" concept.
.
So if our government is being corrupt, we stop working, still holding the jobs we had, and live off welfare that the government is legally obligated to produce.
.
This would pressure our government to take measure to ensure everyone is employed. As well as pressure them to not take certain actions we disagree with.

It's somtimes a useful way to think about otherwise complex systems, absolutely. BUT, it doesn't describe *reality*, it describes an idealized and extremely simplified approximation of reality, and that's the same for pretty much the entire field of economics. There's the real complex world, and then there's the ""world according to economic theory"", and economic theories only accurately describe the latter. And that's totally fine, there's a lot of uses for approximations like that, people aren't criticizing the existence of economics as a field in that sense.
However, what IS a problem is when the ""world according to Economics"" is seen as a scientifically correct and complete description of the real world, instead of just a limited and rough approximation only useful in specific circumstances. When simple economic theories like the laffer curve , or supply and demand for that matter, become scientific fact, not shortcuts to understand some basic but important aspects of what in reality are much more complex systems.
And that is unfortunately largely the way that economics is viewed today in many areas of our society. The most obvious problem is in politics, as very flawed economic theories are used to justify huge economic reforms that have very wide-ranging consequences to our real world. Like the whole trickle down economics thing that refuses to die. We know from evidence that it does not work like that, but despite all evidence, both new and old versions of what is all basically the same theory is brought up time and time again to justify various wealth transfers to the upper classes.
Or in my home country of Sweden where the right wing has been pushing through privatization of sector after sector, every time finding new economic theories (or reusing old ones) to justify why what they are doing is a good idea actually. And yet every time when the results of the reforms start coming in, often years later, it's always a failure.","04/07/2025, 14:01:09",0,No,,,https://www.tiktok.com/@felixjlarsson
