The point of my original comment is that any study constructed to understand anything insists upon itself, not JUST economics as this video posits. People who love gender studies are often the same people who hate economics. People who love religion often find racial studies anathema but they aren't much different. You can gussy up anything with the trappings of academia to give it an air of authority so that people will believe in the the thing. But trappings aren't substance; they are decoration designed precisely for people who don't or won't or can't consumr substance. I'm a very dumb person so I would never claim to be an enlightened genius any more than anyone else commenting on the internet (as you also did). If my comment feels upsetting or like a threat to something, perhaps it's because (as you wisely point out) we must wrestle with difficult ideas and sometimes abandon the ideas in which we once found comfort, in favor of something more closely resembling the truth.","05/07/2025, 00:47:06",0,No,"","",https://www.tiktok.com/@dudeman20123
